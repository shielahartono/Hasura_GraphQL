# The Supergraph Manifesto

```
Domain owners (or data owners, or API producers) should be able to seamlessly connect their domains to the platform. A major challenge in building supergraph is the resistance to change by the domain owners. They often oppose having to build, operate and maintain another API layer, such as a GraphQL server that creates another wrapper on their domain. This reluctance and concern is understandable and completely valid and must be systematically addressed by the supergraph platform strategy and the supergraph reference architecture.
